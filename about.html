                                He was supposed to spend the afternoon deep in his coding projects, crafting sleek HTML layouts and perfecting CSS animations. But instead, curiosity led him down a cinematic rabbit hole — a detour that turned out to be unexpectedly inspiring. </p>

<p class="dark">First came Castlevania: Nocturne (2023), the dark animated Netflix series directed by Sam Deats and Adam Deats. Set against the backdrop of the French Revolution, it follows a new generation of vampire hunters fighting against supernatural and human tyranny. The show’s stunning animation, layered gothic atmosphere, and complex themes of rebellion and injustice made it impossible for him to look away. Its bold voice cast, including Edward Bluemel and Pixie Davies, brought a raw emotional edge to the fight between light and darkness.</p>

<p>Then came The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012), a poignant coming-of-age film directed by Stephen Chbosky. Starring Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, and Ezra Miller, the story delicately explores the fragile transition from adolescence to adulthood, touching on mental health, trauma, and the desperate human need for belonging. Its quiet power, emotional performances, and heartfelt writing resonated deeply — making him pause, reflect, and remember his own moments of feeling invisible in a loud world.</p>

<p class="dark">Finally, 500 Days of Summer (2009) swept him further away from his coding ambitions. Directed by Marc Webb, and starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel, this bittersweet romantic dramedy dismantles the idea of a perfect love story. Told out of order, it captures the messy, beautiful, and often heartbreaking reality of expectations versus truth. One critic once pointed out that while 500 Days of Summer is visually stylish and emotionally relatable, it sometimes relies a little too heavily on its quirky charm, occasionally skimming the deeper contradictions of its characters — a critique he found himself quietly agreeing with, between sighs.</p>

<p>By the end of the day, his code editor remained untouched, but he was richer in stories, emotions, and the quiet understanding that sometimes, getting a little lost is just part of the creative process.</p>
